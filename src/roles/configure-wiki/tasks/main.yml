# inputs:
#   wiki_id
#   wiki_name
#
# all this role needs to do is put a directory named whatever wiki_id is at
# /opt/conf-meza/public/wikis/<wiki_id>
#
# This role DOES NOT actually deploy the wiki to app servers or database
# servers. It simply puts it into configuration. Subsequently it can be
# deployed.
#
# This directory needs to have some minimum requirements:
#   logo.png (is .jpg also allowed?)
#   original.png (is .jpg also allowed? Is this really required?)
#   favicon.ico
#   preLocalSettings.php
#   postLocalSettings.php

# e.g. /opt/conf-meza/public/wikis/foo

# @FIXME: do we really need this to be world-writable?
# Pretty sure that we need to allow apache, meza-ansible, and local 'userx'
# to run scripts that write to this directory.
# like update.php or rebuildData.php.
# We could document proper 'usage' so that any local user running scripts
# must use sudo -u apache for MediaWiki "web" scripts or sudo -u meza-ansible
# for Meza shell scripts (but could those create ownership problems?)
# Need better documentation on the permissions in Meza
# Note: X in symbolic mode means execute a directory, but not files.
# Nobody but Apache can write to mw-temp, so it's not suitable for .smw.json
